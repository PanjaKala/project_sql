SQL Data Analysis Project on Spotify’s most streamed songs of 2023

Dataset on Spotify’s most streamed songs of 2023 is obtained from Kaggle Website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023

The questions I am going to answer based on this Project are:
1.Which artist has the most songs in the top streamed list of 2023?
2.What is the average number of streams for songs released in each month of 2023?
3.Are songs with higher danceability percentages generally more popular (i.e. have more streams)?
4.What percentage of songs in the 'Top Spotify Songs 2023' were actually released in 2023?
5.How many songs are released in 2023 among different age groups(minor or major)?
6.What is the most used ‘Key of the song’?


The project mainly includes four steps:
1.Data Exploration
2.Data Cleaning
3.Data Analysis
4.Conclusion
